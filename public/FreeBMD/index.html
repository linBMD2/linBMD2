<H2>linBMD2 Current Version</H2>

<p>linBMD2 is a Linux transcription program for the
FreeBMD project which comes with its own integral Viewer to make it even easier to use. It also features automated uploading 
of your completed transcriptions to the FreeBMD site. linBMD2 will run on any Linux system. It has been tested on Fedora and Debian, so it should run on any of their derivatives.
<p>

<br/>
<H4> Please Note:</H4>
Version 9.5 was the first that can transcribe files between years 1984 and 1992, no files after 1992 can be transcribed.<br/><br/>

In contrast to versions prior to version 7, linBMD2 now stores it's files in a new folder (by default "linBMD2_Files") under your "My Documents" (or "Documents" in later versions of Windows). When linBMD2 <u>is first run</u> a setup screen will appear allowing you to select this folder after which it will copy all of your existing files into it. There is nothing you need to do except click "Use Default" on that setup screen. Your transcribed files will be copied to an "Output" folder below linBMD2_Files unless you have used the linBMD2 File menu option to select a different location for your transcribed files in which case that location will NOT change and your transcribed files will not be copied.

Important</P>
<p>If you currently have version 5 or 6 installed then after you install version 9 you will find that your previous version and version 9 are both on your computer.  You will have two entries on your Start Menu and two in your Add/Remove Programs (one for your previous version and one for version 9).  It should be obvious which is version 5/6 and which is version 9 (which has a 9 after it's name!). When you have run version 9 <b>at least once</b> you can remove version 5/6 using the appropriate Add/Remove Programs entry. <b>DO NOT</b> remove the previous version until you have run version 9 as it may not be able to copy your files.</p><p> If you upgrade from version 7 or 8 to version 9 then version 7/8 will be removed and you will have only version 9 on your computer, this will not affect your files or settings in any way.</p><br/>
<p>If, after using linBMD2, you have any suggestions for improvements, we would appreciate your comments. Please email us at
